There are over 14,000 AI tools on the market right now. Every week, your inbox has another "revolutionary" AI platform promising to transform your business. Your team is probably already using three or four different tools — some officially, some not.

As a CEO, you don't need to become an AI engineer. But you do need a framework for evaluating which tools are worth your time, money, and organizational effort.

Here's the framework we use with our clients.

## The 4-Filter Framework

Every AI tool should pass through four filters before you commit budget to it. If it fails any one, it's either not ready or not right for you.

### Filter 1: Problem Specificity

**Ask: "What specific problem does this solve?"**

If the answer is vague — "it makes your team more productive" or "it uses AI to optimize your operations" — that's a red flag. The best AI tools solve clearly defined problems.

Good answers sound like: "It reduces invoice processing time from 4 hours to 15 minutes" or "It generates first-draft marketing copy that our team edits in half the time."

### Filter 2: Integration Reality

**Ask: "How does this fit into our existing workflow?"**

The tool that works beautifully in a demo often falls apart when it meets your existing tech stack. Before evaluating features, understand:
- What systems does it need to connect to?
- Does it require your team to change their daily workflow?
- What's the realistic onboarding timeline?

A tool that saves 2 hours per day but requires 3 months of integration work and workflow changes isn't a quick win — it's a project.

### Filter 3: Measurable Impact

**Ask: "How will we know if this is working?"**

If you can't define what success looks like in concrete terms before you buy the tool, you won't be able to justify the investment later. Define your KPIs upfront:
- Time saved per process
- Error rate reduction
- Revenue impact
- Employee adoption rate

### Filter 4: Total Cost of Ownership

**Ask: "What's the real cost — including time, training, and maintenance?"**

License fees are just the beginning. The real cost includes:
- **Training time** — How long before your team is proficient?
- **Integration costs** — Custom development, API connections, data migration
- **Maintenance** — Ongoing support, updates, prompt tuning
- **Opportunity cost** — What else could your team be doing during the transition?

We've seen companies where the "free tier" of an AI tool ended up costing $50K in lost productivity during the adoption phase.

## Red Flags to Watch For

After evaluating hundreds of AI tools, here are the warning signs that a tool isn't ready for enterprise use:

- **No clear pricing** — "Contact sales" for a basic tool is a negotiation trap
- **Overpromising on accuracy** — Any AI tool claiming 99%+ accuracy without context is misleading
- **No data privacy documentation** — If they can't clearly explain where your data goes, walk away
- **Requires "AI expertise" to use** — Good tools are designed for your team, not for data scientists

## The Bottom Line

You don't need to evaluate every AI tool on the market. You need a clear framework and the discipline to say "not yet" to tools that don't pass all four filters.

Start with the processes that cost you the most time and money. Find tools that solve those specific problems. Measure ruthlessly. Scale what works.

That's how companies in the top 8% of AI maturity got there — not by buying everything, but by buying right.
